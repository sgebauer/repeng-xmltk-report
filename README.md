Performance Comparison of XMLTK and Xalan-c - Report
====================================================

This is the LaTeX report for [repeng-xmltk](https://github.com/sgebauer/repeng-xmltk) (also available
[on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7604895)). It is intended to be built automatically by repeng-xmltk's
Docker container.

You can also build it manually using `latexmk -gg -pdf report.tex`.

The directories `results/` and `original_results/` contain the experimental results from our own reproduction and the
original experiment, respectively.
